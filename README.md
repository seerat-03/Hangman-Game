# 🎮 Hangman Game in Python

A classic terminal-based *Hangman Game, where the player must guess a hidden word **one letter at a time* with a maximum of *6 incorrect guesses* allowed.

---

## 📜 Game Rules

🎯 *Objective*: Guess the hidden word before the stickman is fully "hanged"!

🧩 *How to Play*:
1. You’ll be shown the word as a series of underscores (_ _ _)—one for each letter.
2. Guess one letter at a time.
3. For each incorrect guess, you lose a life (❌).
4. You have *6 chances* in total.
5. Win by guessing the full word before the stickman is complete.

💡 *Hints*:
- Letters are not case-sensitive.
- Repeating guesses won’t cost you an extra life—but they also won’t help!
